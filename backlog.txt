Bugs:
 - Sometimes lines break, when they are moved off canvas.
 - Tolerance uses internal coordinates but should use canvas coordinates (Fixed?)
 - Labels should work for lines and circles.

Further geometric constructions:
 - CircumCenter (Done but could be optimized)
 - Orthocenter
 - Lines tangent to circle through point

Maybe I should add these?:
 - Radical axis
 - Radical center
 - EulerLine
 - Nine point circle

Interact with objects:
 - Thickness
 - Make objects invisible
 - Add labels

Points snap to lines/circles.
