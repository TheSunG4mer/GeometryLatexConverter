Make half lines

Further geometric constructions:
 - CircumCenter (Done but could be optimized)
 - Orthocenter
 - Lines tangent to circle through point

Maybe I should add these?:
 - Radical axis
 - Radical center
 - EulerLine
 - Nine point circle

Zoom/move canvas functionality.

Interact with objects:
 - Color
 - Thickness
 - Make objects invisible


Points snap to lines/circles.
